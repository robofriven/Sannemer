To start off

	Health Bar - 20 Pts wins the round
	Leftover health = end score of round
	After 3 rounds, highest score wins
		tiebreaker = the 2 winner

		-Random deck
			1 1 - 15 15
			4 fancy ones types
				S1-A Damage = opp attack
				S2-A Damage = opp Def
				S1-D Copy opp Def
				S2-D Copy opp Att as Def (causes draw on round)

				S3 - Your Attack/Defense = your Defense/Attack
				S4: Defense of Defense card is S. Defense = Defense of Att card and Att + 1

	-Each player throws down 2 cards, off and def
		Off is compared to def and the difference = the dam (if greater)

		Use Quill18's item system for the cards since he did something similar as his tutorial

	
	-Single player (AI Types: Off, Def, balanced... random choice)
	-Multiplayer (2 players to start)

		- Deal 6 cards per hand 30 card deck
			- 2 play modes
				- Play out entire hand before drawing
				- Draw 2 more every time
				
				
Future Ideas
- Magic style cards
- Races
	- Humans cheaper but don't get as strong but have more abilities etc
	- non humans have bigger numbers but not as special, etc.
- Use the item system to make a database and an editor to add things to it.


Order of things to do

-Method for drawing cards (add deck[0] to hand and remove deck[0])






-Build the deck dynamically
	- Right now it builds it randomly, need to implement it from the deck
