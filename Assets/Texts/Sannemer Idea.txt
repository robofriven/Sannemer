To start off

	Health Bar - 20 Pts wins the round
	Leftover health = end score of round
	After 3 rounds, highest score wins
		tiebreaker = the 2 winner

		-Random deck
			1 1 - 15 15
			4 fancy ones types
				S1-A Damage = opp attack
				S2-A Damage = opp Def    ----- Probably won't work
					Defense = 5 (something) + 5 to attack
				S1-D Copy opp Def
				S2-D Copy opp Att as Def (causes draw on round)

				S3 - Your Attack/Defense = your Defense/Attack
				S4: Defense of Defense card is S. Defense = Defense of Att card and Att + 1
				S5: Swap offense and defense values on opp card (1/15 turns 15/1)


	
	-Single player (AI Types: Off, Def, balanced... random choice)
	-Multiplayer (2 players to start)

		- Deal 6 cards per hand 30 card deck
			- 2 play modes
				- Play out entire hand before drawing
				- Draw 2 more every time

Current Bugs/TODO list:

- Doesnt clear score at the end of the game


	Ways to deal with ties
		Before it comes to a tie the choice is made to be offense or defensive so ties never technically happen as the card is pulled before the tie happens
Work on making it multi player (Photon initialization, photonnetwork.instantiate, etc, offline mode)
Get the Health bars and name fields set up
Menu button for the console
Get the camera to zoom in on the console when the menu is brought up

			
Short term ideas:
Animation after the hand is over?			
				
				
Future Ideas

Taking Steampunk theme 3 steps too far.
	Game is a kiosk at a bar or something that you sit and play.  The console to the right runs the game whereas the machinery is what makes the whole thing work.  When you take damage it lets out that many units of steam.
	The cards are completely customizable (with everything having a cost to put it together) with gears that represent the numerical values of the cards and "resistors" that represent special abilities. (+1 attack, etc)


- Races
	- Humans cheaper but don't get as strong but have more abilities etc
	- non humans have bigger numbers but not as special, etc.
- Use the item system to make a database and an editor to add things to it.

Order of things to do

-Build the deck dynamically
	- Right now it builds it randomly, need to implement it from the deck
